 __label__OK
Well, let me just say hello everyone.  __label__OK
I am so thrilled to be here with you all today in New Hampshire.  __label__OK
This is like home to me, and this day - thank you for a beautiful fall day. __label__OK
You just ordered this day up for me, didnt you? Its great to be here. __label__OK
Let me start by thanking your fabulous governor, your next U.S. senator, Maggie Hassan.  __label__OK
I want to thank her for that lovely introduction.  __label__OK
all of whom have been just terrific friends to us.  __label__OK
And, of course, thanks to all of you for taking the time to be here today. __label__OK
Thanks so much. Thats very sweet of you.  __label__OK
I love you guys too.  __label__OK
I cant believe its just a few weeks before Election Day, as we come together to support the next President and Vice President of the United States, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine! __label__OK
And New Hampshire is going to be important, as always. __label__OK
 __label__OK
So I'm going to get a little serious here, because I think we can all agree that this has been a rough week in an already rough election.  __label__OK
This week has been particularly interesting for me personally because it has been a week of profound contrast. __label__OK
See, on Tuesday, at the White House, we celebrated the International Day of the Girl and Let Girls Learn, and it was a wonderful celebration. It was the last event that I'm going to be doing as First Lady for Let Girls Learn.  __label__OK
And I had the pleasure of spending hours talking to some of the most amazing young women you will ever meet, young girls here in the U.S. and all around the world. And we talked about their hopes and their dreams.  __label__OK
We talked about their aspirations. See, because many of these girls have faced unthinkable obstacles just to attend school, jeopardizing their personal safety, their freedom, risking the rejection of their families and communities. __label__OK
So I thought it would be important to remind these young women how valuable and precious they are.  __label__OK
I wanted them to understand that the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls.  __label__OK
And I told them that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and I told them that they should disregard anyone who demeans or devalues them, and that they should make their voices heard in the world.  __label__OK
And I walked away feeling so inspired, just like I'm inspired by all the young people here __label__OK
I was so uplifted by these girls. That was Tuesday. __label__OK
 __label__OK
And now, here I am, out on the campaign trail in an election  __label__OK
where we have consistently been hearing hurtful, hateful language about women -  __label__OK
language that has been painful for so many of us, not just as women,  __label__OK
but as parents trying to protect our children and raise them to be caring, respectful adults,  __label__OK
and as citizens who think that our nation's leaders should meet basic standards of human decency. __label__OK
 __label__OK
The fact is that in this election, we have a candidate for President of the United States who,  __label__OK
over the course of his lifetime and the course of this campaign,  __label__OK
has said things about women that are so shocking, so demeaning that I simply will not repeat anything here today.  __label__OK
And last week, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women.  __label__OK
And I can't believe that I'm saying that a candidate for  __label__OK
President of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women. __label__OK
And I have to tell you that I can't stop thinking about this.  __label__OK
It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted.  __label__OK
So while I'd love nothing more than to pretend like this isn't happening, and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest and disingenuous to me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream. __label__OK
This is not something that we can ignore.  __label__OK
It's not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season.  __label__OK
Because this was not just a "lewd conversation."  __label__OK
This wasn't just locker-room banter.  __label__OK
This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly  __label__OK
about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women,  __label__OK
using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV. __label__OK
And to make matters worse, it now seems very clear that this isn't an isolated incident.  __label__OK
It's one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life.  __label__OK
And I have to tell you that I listen to all of this and I feel it so personally, and I'm sure that many of you do too, particularly the women.  __label__OK
The shameful comments about our bodies.  __label__OK
The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect.  __label__OK
The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman. __label__OK
 __label__OK
It is cruel. It's frightening.  __label__OK
And the truth is, it hurts. It hurts.  __label__OK
It's like that sick, sinking feeling you get when you're walking down the street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words about your body.  __label__OK
Or when you see that guy at work that stands just a little too close, stares a little too long, and makes you feel uncomfortable in your own skin. __label__OK
It's that feeling of terror and violation that too many women have felt when someone has grabbed them,  __label__OK
It reminds us of stories we heard from our mothers and grandmothers about how, back in their day, the boss could say and do whatever he pleased to the women in the office,  __label__OK
We thought all of that was ancient history, didn't we? __label__OK
And so many have worked for so many years to end this kind of violence and abuse and disrespect, but here we are in 2016 and we're hearing these exact same things every day on the campaign trail.  __label__OK
We are drowning in it. And all of us are doing what women have always done: We're trying to keep our heads above water, just trying to get through it, trying to pretend like this doesn't really bother us maybe because we think that admitting how much it hurts makes us as women look weak. __label__OK
 __label__OK
Maybe we're afraid to be that vulnerable.  __label__OK
Maybe we've grown accustomed to swallowing these emotions and staying quiet, because we've seen that people often won't take our word over his.  __label__OK
Or maybe we don't want to believe that there are still people out there who think so little of us as women.  __label__OK
Too many are treating this as just another day's headline, as if our outrage is overblown or unwarranted, as if this is normal, just politics as usual. __label__OK
But, New Hampshire, be clear: This is not normal.  __label__OK
This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. __label__OK
It is intolerable. __label__OK
And it doesn't matter what party you belong to - Democrat, Republican, independent - no woman deserves to be treated this way. None of us deserves this kind of abuse. __label__OK
And I know it's a campaign, but this isn't about politics.  __label__OK
It's about basic human decency.  __label__OK
It's about right and wrong.  __label__OK
And we simply cannot endure this, or expose our children to this any longer - not for another minute, and let alone for four years. Now is the time for all of us to stand up and say enough is enough. __label__OK
This has got to stop right now. __label__OK
So for the next 26 days, we need to do everything we can to help her and Tim Kaine win this election.  __label__OK
I know I'm going to be doing it. __label__OK
Are you with me?  __label__OK
Are you all with me?  __label__OK
You ready to roll up your sleeves?  __label__OK
Get to work knocking on doors? __label__OK
All right, let's get to work.  __label__OK
Thank you all.  __label__OK
God bless. __label__OK
Fine, thanks. __label__OK
Where are you off to? __label__OK
To the library __label__OK
I'll see you later then.  __label__OK
Good luck. __label__OK
See you later.  __label__OK
It's nice to meet you __label__OK
I work for the __label__OK
Who's the tall women __label__OK
Let me introduce you __label__OK
Would you like a drink __label__OK
What time is it __label__OK
We're going to be late __label__OK
Sounds good! __label__OK
Sorry __label__OK
Thank you __label__OK
Well, hello there __label__OK
Long time no see __label__OK
What a small world __label__OK
I hope that you are not offensive __label__OK
My toes are going numb __label__OK
